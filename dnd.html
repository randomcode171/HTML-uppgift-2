          <h2>How to create a D&D Character</h2>
          <p>D&D is a tabletop roleplaying game with it's origin lying in the 1970's. You usually play with 4 or more players and one "Dungeon Master" acting as the master of the game, directing what happens and what doesn't happen in the roleplaying experience. </p>
          <p>To create a character you will need to decide what Species they belong to, from what Background them came from, and what Class they are. This article will go through those 3 aspects in detail.</p>

        <h3>Species</h3>
        <p>Your Species defines what lineage you come from, who your forefathers were. If you had Dragonborn parents you'll be a Dragomborn yourself, and will then get certain qualities that Dragonborn possess. Same with any other species. Your species doesn't necessarily decide what path you will stride in life, even if you are a short Halfling, you can still be a Barbarian wielding a mighty sword.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Your Background defines who you were before you decided to become an adventurer, if you were a criminal living on the streets, or a sage doing research. Your Background defines what skills you have learned and who you are today, what you are good or bad at. The Background does have quite an impactful effect on the viability of your class since it provides 3 valuable Ability Score points. </p>

        <h3>Class</h3>
        <p>Your Class is the major defining factor of your experience playing D&D. It decides what abilities you have, if you can cast spells or if you can hide well. If you want to be a holy knight, you should choose to be a wizard. If you want to be an explorer of nature, a Ranger might be the class for you. </p>
